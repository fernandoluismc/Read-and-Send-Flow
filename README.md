# Hydrotics

Python code for communication between Raspberry Pi's using NRF24L01+ using [Newly Optimized RF24Network Layer](http://tmrh20.github.io/RF24Network/classRF24Network.html#ac8e9571bb3d2c20d00955b8f5c15b541). The "Sender" reads the flow from a YS-201F Sensor and sends to "Receiver" using NRF24L01+ transceiver.

## Installation

* Install [RF24Network](https://github.com/nRF24/RF24Network).
* Compile the C++ code then execute the setup.py scripts from  nrRF24/RF24/pyRF24/pyRF24Network and nRF24/RFNetwork/RPi/pyNRF24Network
* Install sqlite3 ('sudo apt-get install sqlite3')
## Usage
 1. Execute the "Receiver" code (sudo python Rec/Receiver.py)
 2. Execute the "Sender" code (sudo python Send/Sender.py)


## Pins and Connections

*YS-201F Connections* (Change to Fritizing)

Red ------------- 5V
           +----- 3V3
           |
          10K
           |
Yellow ----+----- GPIO23 (BCM Mode) or Pin 16 (BOARD Mode)
Black ----------- Ground

*NRF24L01+ Connections* (Draw with Fritizin)
Both transceivers have a 10Î¼F electrolytic capacitor between GND and VCC pins (positive lead of the capacitor to GND and the negative lead to VCC).
